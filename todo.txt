# WORKFLOW
1. create an .md file in some dir
2. make changes to that file, ideally we have a scryb watch <filename> to live reload file in browser
3. when you are ready to publish run scryb publish <filename> --target=<target> to publish the file

basically, all .md files are untracked
when you publish a file it gets tracked in a .scryb config
when you publish n files at the same time the ordering is arbitrary
when you republish a file with the same name as an existing file in the target dir, it just gets a 'last modified' section
